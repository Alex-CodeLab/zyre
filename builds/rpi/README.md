# Raspberry Pi

Cross compile environment for the Raspberry Pi (all models)

## Cross compiling for Raspbian

Simply run

    ./build.sh

Once the build script finishes everything is install at `tmp/`. You can use
rsync to copy everything onto your Pi. At you'll have to make sure rsync is
installed on the Raspberry Pi

    sudo apt-get install rsync

Next make sure your Pi user has sufficient rights to copy data to `/usr/local`.
To force this you can use the following command to change the ownership of the
directory accordingly.

    chown -R root:users /usr/local/

And finally sync your libraries to the Pi

    rsync -avz tmp/ <pi-user>@<pi-ip>:/usr/local

The first time you install a library onto the Raspberry Pi you'll need to run

    sudo ldconfig

## Cross compile and install into Raspbian image

This requires sudo rights. Also make sure you have `kpartx`, `qemu-user` and
`proot` installed.

To cross compile and install this project to an raspbian image run

    ./build_image.sh

This script will download the latest Raspbian image extend it so we can install
software into it and finally copy the cross compiled stuff to it. Once it's done
simple copy the image to a SD card and plug it into your Raspberry Pi.
